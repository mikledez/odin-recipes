    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>6-8 pieces of chicken</p>
    <p>6-8 ounce can coconut milk</p>
    <p>1 cup cider vinegar</p>
    <p>1 cup soy sauce</p>
    <p>1 tablespoon black pepper corns</p>
    <p>2 large onions, quartered</p>
    <p>2 tablespoons yellow curry powder</p>
    <p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>

    <p>Heat <strong>oil</strong> in a large pot over medium heat. <strong>Chicken breasts should be cut in half to have more equally sized pieces of chicken.</strong>   
        <p>Season chicken with <strong>salt</strong>. Add chicken to <strong>oil</strong>, skin side down, cooking 2-3 minutes on each side. 
            When chicken begins to brown on all sides, add the <strong>cider vinegar</strong>, <strong>soy sauce</strong>, <strong>pepper corns</strong>, and 
            <strong>onions</strong>.</p>  
        
        Mix well and cover the pot with a lid.  Cook for about 15 minutes.  Remove lid and continue simmering.  Check doneness of chicken by cutting a piece of the dark 
        meat to make sure there is no pinkish color.  (Chicken cooked until the internal temperature reaches at least 165Â°F as measured using a food thermometer.)  
        Reduce heat to low and add the <strong>curry powder</strong> and <strong>coconut milk</strong>.  Cook for another 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to reduce and thicken. </p>
